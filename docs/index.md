# Welcome to Niomon Developer Docs

We are happy to see you here! This developer website contains technical references for our products
and instructions to get started.

## What is Niomon

Niomon is a secure authentication infrastructure for Web3. We aim to support the next 10 million
users to adopt Web3 decentralized identities and crypto. Our suite of APIs and SDKs make it easy
for developers to integrate wallet-based logins and self-custodial crypto wallet functions into any
application (both centralized or decentralized architecture). With Niomon, you can easily onboard
users new to crypto within seconds.

## Closed beta

Niomon is in closed beta. While we are ready for production, we want to focus our resources to
support a targeted group of customers. Hence, sign-up is currently limited. We are constantly
improving our products, so your comments and criticisms are very important to us. Please reach out
to us to provide your feedback.
